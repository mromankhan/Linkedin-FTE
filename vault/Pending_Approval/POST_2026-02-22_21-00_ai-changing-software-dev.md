AI isn't just a tool for developers anymore. It's becoming the co-pilot.

In 2026, the developers who ship fastest aren't the ones who know the most syntax — they're the ones who've learned to delegate the right tasks to AI.

Here are 5 ways AI has fundamentally changed how software gets built:

1. Boilerplate is dead — Cursor and Copilot write it while you think
2. Code reviews happen in seconds — not days
3. Debugging is a conversation, not a hunt
4. Docs write themselves as you code
5. Architecture decisions are validated instantly against best practices

The skill gap isn't "can you code" anymore.
It's "can you direct AI to code better than the next developer?"

What's the biggest AI shift you've seen in your dev workflow this year?
